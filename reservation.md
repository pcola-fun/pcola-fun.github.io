## Reserved Seating Events

If you're here, it's because you're signing up for a reserved-seating event. Events like this
generate a lot of interest and we can't accommodate everyone. There is usually a waitlist.

No shows to events like this make us look bad in the eyes of the venue and deprive an otherwise 
interested person on the waitlist from having the experience. Unfortuantely, this is a somewhat
common occurrence. As a result, we have had to put the following in place:

- For some events, we will limit attendance to existing members (and their guests). New members are encouraged to attend a different event as their introduction to the group.
- For some events, we may collect a small deposit to hold your place. At the event, we will return your deposit. If you cancel within a short window before the event (usually a week), or if you no-show, your deposit is non-refundable.  If you are being asked for a deposit, use a method of payment listed [here](/payment/).

The event description will tell you which (if any) of these conditions apply to your event.  It is unfortunate that we have had to
put this in place. We appreciate your understanding.
