## It says I'm paying $5/month in dues!

Ugh. This has truly been a frustrating one.

First, please make sure you're not seeing a charge for Meetup+.  More info is <a href="/faq/plus">here</a>.

That said, if your profile page shows **$5/month** for member dues for **Nothing But Fun**, that means you're an old-timer! Thanks for being around with us for so long.

There was a glitch a long time ago, where members were charged the correct $5/year amount, but marked in Meetup's database as a $5/month subscriber. Unfortunately, when your anniversary date rolls around, they want to start charging you monthly! ðŸ˜³ And, Meetup.com has been unwilling to fix this for us.

### So how do we fix this?

There are a couple possible fixes that we can do manually. Please get in touch with Kyle, to see which one will work best for your account.
