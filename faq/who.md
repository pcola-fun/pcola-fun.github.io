## Who are we, anyway?

We’re a group of fun loving peeps who just want to be out and social, living life to the fullest in the Greater Pensacola area. Many of us are new to the area.

### What do we do?

We have fun!  We create regular events around food or drink or music.  We have regular outdoor activities like paddle boarding, hiking, or biking.  We do activities like sky diving, offshore fishing, horseback riding, tubing, or camping on the beach.  There really isn't much we can't or won't do. Anything that lets us have a fun time, enjoy the fact that we live in paradise, and spend quality time with our friends, is fair game.  If you have an idea for an event, or would like to host something special, let the [leadership team](https://www.meetup.com/pcola-fun/members/?op=leaders) know!

### Drama free zone!

We have an important [rule](/faq/rules): Everyone in the group has the right to feel safe and comfortable at all times. Be kind. Don't bring drama. We have zero tolerance for things that make people want to leave the group. Violators will be shown the door swiftly.

### Meetup is not a hookup site

The name meetup.com does sound like a dating site, doesn't it?  It's not. It's a site for building communities.

**Nothing But Fun** is certainly _not_ a hookup/singles group. And we are not your next dating pool. This doesn't mean you can't date someone in the group; certainly we have couples here. It means [don't come in here on the prowl](/faq/rules). People don't want to be hit on at every turn. It makes people uncomfortable, which is the opposite of what we're about. (If this happens to you, report it to your event organizer right away.)
