# Nothing But Fun

### What are the annual dues, and why?

**Nothing But Fun** charges $5/year for annual dues. (If you are being charged more than this, or more frequently than this, you have probably signed up for <a href="/faq/meetup_plus">Meetup+</a>, which has nothing to do with us.)

There are two reasons we charge a minimal fee to be a member of the group:
1) We find that it keeps out the creepers. Yes, sadly, there are creepers on meetup.
2) Meetup.com charges us $300/year to use the site 

### How do we spend the money?

First, we pay the costs of organizing:
- We pay $300/year to Meetup
- We pay the fees associated with hosting this pcola.fun site
- We occasionally buy recruiting materials, such as business cards

Whatever is left over at the end of the year goes back to the members in some way, such as a party, buying food at a large group event, etc.

### It says I'm paying $5/month!

Some people have experienced a <a href="/faq/glitch">glitch</a> that causes their account to revert to month.  Kyle can help you fix it. More info <a href="/faq/glitch">here</a>.
