## What are the annual dues, and why?

**Nothing But Fun** charges $5/year for annual dues. (If you are being charged more than this, or more frequently than this, you have probably signed up for [Meetup+](/faq/plus), which has nothing to do with us.)

### How do we spend the money?

First, we pay the costs of organizing:
- We pay $300/year to Meetup in order to have the group
- We pay the fees associated with hosting this pcola.fun site
- We occasionally buy recruiting materials, such as business cards

Everything left over at the end of the year goes back to the members in some way, such as a party, buying food at a large group event, etc.

### It says I'm paying $5/month!

Some members that joined before we switched organizers have experienced a [glitch](/faq/glitch) that causes their account to revert to monthly. Kyle can help you fix it. More info [here](/faq/glitch).

If you're paying $4.99 or $5.99 or any other amount that ends in .99, you're paying for [Meetup+](/faq/plus), which has nothing to do with our annual does.
