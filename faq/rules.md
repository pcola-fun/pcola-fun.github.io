## Three Simple Rules

We're here to have fun, and a big ol' list of rules is no fun. But, we do have three simple ones that everyone
is expected to follow.

- Be respectful when RSVP'ing to events
  Many of our events are attendance limited (especially sit down meals or other small spaces), and an RSVP does not mean "I'm interested in this", it means "I will be there".  No-shows make us look bad to the venue.  More importantly, no-shows cheat other members out of a seat.  So, please do not RSVP for events unless you know you will go. If your plans change, please fix your RSVP as soon as possible before the event, so someone else can take your spot. For certain high-interest, low-availability events, we may
  [collect a deposit](/payment) to help manage the no-show problem.  
- Be respectful of other members
  We expect all members to leave drama at the door.  Find another outlet for politics, religion, and gossip because we don't want it here. It makes people uncomfortable, which is the opposite of what we're about. (If this happens to you, report it to your organizer right away.)
- This is not a dating pool
  This doesn't mean you can't date someone in the group; certainly we have couples here. It just means don't come in here on the prowl. People don't want to be hit on at every turn. It makes people uncomfortable, which is the opposite of what we're about. (If this happens to you, report it to your organizer right away.)

That's it! We just want everyone to be respectful and have fun. Pretty simple, really. Thanks for reading, now on with the fun!
