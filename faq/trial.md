# Nothing But Fun

### How does the trial work?

Since you're asking, that means you are probably thinking of joining, or have just joined as a trial member. Welcome!

**Nothing But Fun** charges <a href="/faq/dues">annual dues</a> to offset the cost of running the group.  Since no one likes to pay for something they don't know anything about yet, we give you a month to kick the tires. Attend a few events and have some fun, then join as a full member.

Now ... Meetup could make the transition from trial to full member a little easier. We truly wish they were better about this.  So, here are some things you need to know:

- Three days before your trial ends, they'll send you an email to tell you. Please make sure you have notifications turned on so you get this reminder!
- Before the trial ends, you will need to have a credit card on file with meetup.com, and authorize the auto-charge. Otherwise, your account will fail to renew, and you will fall into the "awaiting dues" list. "Awaiting dues" is effectively "non-member". 

### What happens if I don't renew?

- If your membership does not renew, Meetup will automatically remove you from all RSVP'ed events. (Please note that the event organizer is not notified of this. You simply vanish, and we don't know what happened ... it's frustrating for all involved, but it's how Meetup does it.)
-  You won't be able to RSVP to any more events until you are marked paid.

### Do I have to give meetup my credit card?

No. If you would rather pay cash, you can give it to any member of the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/pcola-fun/members/?op=leaders">leadership team</a> instead.
