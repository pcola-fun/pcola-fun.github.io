# Nothing But Fun

## What is Meetup+?

Meetup.com has a premium product called Meetup+ that offers you extra features while using their app or website. They're pretty sneaky in that they sell it to you at the time that you're signing up for meetup groups, so it looks like you're paying us.

_Meetup+ has nothing to do with our meetup group_.  And, to be completely honest, it doesn't seem to be even remotely worth the price they charge for it.

Please understand that the recurring fee for Meetup+ has _absolutely nothing_ to do with **Nothing But Fun**, and paying it is not the same as paying our <a href="/faq/dues">annual dues</a>. Meetup+ money doesn't go to us. You can decline Meetup+ (or, if you're already subscribed, you can cancel) and it will not affect your membership in the **Nothing But Fun** group at all.

While using parts of the app/website, you're going to get popups asking you to sign up for it. It's very annoying. Please know that there's nothing we can do about it. It's entirely Meetup.com upselling you on a "premium" service.
