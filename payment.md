## Event Payments & How They Work

We're so excited you're interested in joining us for some of our upcoming events! To make sure everyone has a fantastic experience, we sometimes need to handle payments in advance. Here's a quick rundown on why and how:


### **Ticketed Events**

For some of our most popular outings, we need you to buy your own ticket directly from the venue. This is usually because the venue has limited capacity. **Please don't RSVP "Yes" until you've purchased your ticket!** This helps us avoid last-minute changes and ensures that those who truly want to attend can secure their spot before they sell out.

### **Paying for Your Spot**

For certain events, we'll ask you to pay the organizer directly in advance. This helps us confirm bookings and guarantee your place.

*   **Advance Payment is Key:** This payment is usually collected upfront, especially if we must pay the venue in advance.
*   **Non-Refundable:** Please note that these payments are non-refundable. If you find you can no longer attend, we kindly ask that you find someone to take your spot. You can coordinate with the event organizer to transfer your payment to the new person.

### **Event Deposits (for Reservable Spots)**

For highly sought-after events, especially those requiring reservations like group dinners, we may ask for a small deposit.

*   **Why a Deposit?** This helps us secure limited spots with restaurants and venues. Unfortunately, we've had members sign up but not attend, which can leave us looking bad and prevents others from enjoying the experience.
*   **Getting Your Deposit Back:** When you attend the event, your deposit will be returned to you! If you're a no-show, the deposit will not be refunded.
