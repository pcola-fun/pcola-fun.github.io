## Welcome to Nothing But Fun!

Ready to join the fun? Click here to get started:
[**Join Nothing But Fun on Meetup**](https://meetup.com/pcola-fun)

### A Quick Heads-Up Before You Sign Up:

If you're already a Meetup member, feel free to skip this section and click the link above.

If you're new to Meetup, there's something important to know about the signup process:

- **Beware of "Meetup+"!** While signing up for a Meetup account, you'll likely see an offer for a premium service called "Meetup+". **This service has NOTHING to do with Nothing But Fun or your ability to attend our events.**
- **You do NOT need Meetup+ to join us.** Please feel free to decline this offer. It won't impact your membership with our group.
- **Our Dues:** The *only* cost associated with Nothing But Fun is a small **$5 annual membership fee**, which is only due *after* your free <a href="/faq/trial">one-month trial</a>.

We want to make sure you're not confused by Meetup's upsell. Many new members have accidentally signed up for Meetup+ thinking it was part of our group. We recommend you **skip Meetup+** during signup and get to know us first!

**We can't wait to see you at an event!**
